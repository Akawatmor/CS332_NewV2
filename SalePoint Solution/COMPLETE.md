## 🎯 **METHOD 1: One-Command Deployment (Recommended)**

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd "/Users/kong/Desktop/CS232-332_Cloud/final_project/CS332_NewV2_1/SalePoint Solution"
```

### Step 2: Run Complete Deployment
```bash
chmod +x deploy-complete.sh
./deploy-complete.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Deploys backend infrastructure (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB)
- Tests all API endpoints
- Builds and deploys frontend
- Configures authentication-free demo mode
- Provides working dashboard URL

**Expected Output:**
```
🎉 Complete Deployment Successful!
🌐 Dashboard URL: http://salepoint-frontend-XXXXXX-us-east-1.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
📊 API URL: https://XXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
```

### Step 3: Access Your Application
Open the dashboard URL in your browser - no login required!

## 🔧 **METHOD 2: Step-by-Step Deployment**

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Infrastructure
```bash
cd "/Users/kong/Desktop/CS232-332_Cloud/final_project/CS332_NewV2_1/SalePoint Solution"

./deploy-learner-lab-simple.sh
```

**What this creates:**
- CloudFormation stack: `salepoint-lab`
- API Gateway with endpoints
- Lambda functions for business logic
- DynamoDB tables for data storage

### Step 2: Test and Configure APIs
```bash
chmod +x test-learner-lab.sh
./test-learner-lab.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Tests all API endpoints
- Updates frontend configuration with real API URLs
- Validates backend deployment

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend Demo
```bash
chmod +x deploy-demo.sh
./deploy-demo.sh
```

**What this creates:**
- Builds React frontend application
- Uploads to S3 bucket with static website hosting
- Configures demo mode (no authentication required)
- Provides immediate access to dashboard

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: AWS CLI not configured
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your Learner Lab credentials
```

#### Issue: Permission denied on scripts
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

#### Issue: Node.js not installed
```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install node

# Or download from https://nodejs.org/
```

#### Issue: Stack already exists
```bash
# Delete existing stack first
./cleanup.sh
# Then redeploy
./deploy-complete.sh
```

#### Issue: Frontend shows errors
```bash
# Redeploy demo version
./deploy-demo.sh
```

## 💰 **Cost Management**

### Learner Lab Credits Usage
- **Backend deployment**: ~30-50 credits
- **Frontend hosting**: ~10-20 credits
- **Ongoing usage**: ~5-10 credits per hour

### Cost Optimization
- Use cleanup script when done testing
- Monitor credit usage in Learner Lab console
- Deploy only when actively testing

---

## 🚨 **When You're Done Testing**

### Save Your Credits
```bash
# Clean up all resources
chmod +x cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
```

**This will delete everything** - you'll need to redeploy from Step 1 if you want to use it again.

---

## 📝 **Summary**

1. **Choose your deployment method** (one-command recommended)
2. **Run the deployment script(s)** in order
3. **Access your dashboard** using the provided URL
4. **Test the application** features
5. **Clean up resources** when done to save credits

Your SalePoint solution will be fully functional with a modern web interface and working backend APIs!
