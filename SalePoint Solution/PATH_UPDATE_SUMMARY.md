All hardcoded absolute paths have been converted to relative paths that work from any user's environment after cloning the repository.

### 📝 Specific Changes

#### 1. Prerequisites Section (NEW)
**Added:** Clear instructions for users after cloning
```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate to the SalePoint Solution directory
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd "[repository-name]/SalePoint Solution"
```

#### 2. Quick Verification Section
**Before:**
```bash
cd "/Users/kong/Desktop/CS232-332_Cloud/final_project/CS332_NewV2_1/SalePoint Solution"
```

**After:**
```bash
cd "SalePoint Solution"
```

#### 3. Step-by-Step Execution Section

### 🎯 Total Updates Made

- ✅ **3 hardcoded absolute paths** converted to relative paths
- ✅ **1 new prerequisites section** added with clone instructions
- ✅ **All `cd` commands** now use relative paths
- ✅ **Repository-agnostic** - works for any user after cloning

### 📋 Current State

All path references in `A_one-stop-service_deploy.md` now use:
```bash
cd "SalePoint Solution"
```

Instead of the previous hardcoded:
```bash
cd "/Users/kong/Desktop/CS232-332_Cloud/final_project/CS332_NewV2_1/SalePoint Solution"
```

### 🚀 User Experience Improvement

**Before:** Users had to manually edit the deployment guide to match their local paths
**After:** Users can follow the guide exactly as written after cloning the repository

### ✅ Verification

Searched for remaining absolute paths:
- ❌ No `/Users/` references found
- ❌ No `Desktop` references found
- ✅ All `cd` commands use relative paths
- ✅ Guide is now portable across different user environments

## 🎉 Result

The deployment guide is now **fully portable** and ready for distribution. Users can:

1. Clone the repository to any location
2. Navigate to the "SalePoint Solution" directory
3. Follow the guide exactly as written
4. All paths will work correctly regardless of their system or directory structure
