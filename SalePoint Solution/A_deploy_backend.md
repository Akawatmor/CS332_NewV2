## 🛠️ SCRIPT EXECUTION HIERARCHY

### 🎯 Main Deployment Script (Run This First)
| Script | Purpose | Duration | Execution Order |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| `./deploy-foolproof.sh` | **MASTER SCRIPT** - Orchestrates complete deployment | 20-25 minutes | **START HERE** |

### 🔄 Internal Scripts (Called Automatically by deploy-foolproof.sh)
| Script | Purpose | Duration | Phase |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| `./deploy-learner-lab-simple.sh` | Infrastructure deployment (CloudFormation) | 15-20 minutes | Phase 2 |
| `./fix-lambda-502-final.sh` | Lambda function packaging and fixes | 2-3 minutes | Phase 3 |
| `./deploy-complete-final.sh` | Status checking and verification | 1-2 minutes | Phase 4 |

### 📊 Status & Validation Scripts (Independent)
| Script | Purpose | Duration | When to Use |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `./quick-status.sh` | Quick deployment health check | 10 seconds | Anytime |
| `./validate-deployment.sh` | Comprehensive validation with details | 30 seconds | After deployment |
| `./test-api.sh` | Test all API endpoints | 30 seconds | After deployment |

### 🧹 Maintenance Scripts (Independent)
| Script | Purpose | Duration | When to Use |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|

| `./init-sample-data.sh` | Add sample data to DynamoDB | 1 minute | After deployment |

### 🔧 Manual Scripts (Use Only If Needed)
| Script | Purpose | Duration | When to Use |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `./deploy-learner-lab-simple.sh` | Manual infrastructure deployment | 15-20 minutes | If main script fails |

## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION FLOW

### Recommended: Single Command Deployment
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/kong/Desktop/CS232-332_Cloud/final_project/CS332_NewV2_1/SalePoint Solution"

# Run the master deployment script
./deploy-foolproof.sh
```

**This script automatically executes the following sequence:**

1. **Phase 1:** Permission setup and prerequisites check
2. **Phase 2:** Calls `./deploy-learner-lab-simple.sh` for infrastructure
3. **Phase 3:** Calls `./fix-lambda-502-final.sh` for Lambda fixes  
4. **Phase 4:** Calls validation functions from `./deploy-complete-final.sh`
5. **Phase 5:** Final verification and status display

### Alternative: Manual Step-by-Step (Advanced Users Only)
```bash
# Step 1: Deploy infrastructure
./deploy-learner-lab-simple.sh

# Step 2: Fix Lambda functions (if needed)
./fix-lambda-502-final.sh

# Step 3: Verify deployment
./validate-deployment.sh

# Step 4: Check final status
./quick-status.sh
```

---

## ⚡ QUICK ACTIONS

### Check Current Status
```bash
./quick-status.sh
```

### Validate Everything is Working
```bash
./validate-deployment.sh
```

### Add Sample Data (After Deployment)
```bash
./init-sample-data.sh
```

### Clean Up When Done
```bash
./cleanup.sh
```
```bash
# Check if already deployed
./quick-status.sh

# Deploy from scratch (recommended)
./deploy-foolproof.sh

# Validate everything is working
./validate-deployment.sh

# Add sample data for testing
./init-sample-data.sh

# Clean up when done
./cleanup.sh
```

---

## 🛠️ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT (Step by Step)

**If you prefer manual control, follow these steps:**

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd "/Users/kong/Desktop/CS232-332_Cloud/final_project/CS332_NewV2_1/SalePoint Solution"
```

### Step 2: Clean Up Any Existing Resources
```bash
./cleanup.sh salepoint-lab us-east-1 true
```

**Duration:** 3-5 minutes  
**What this does:** Removes any existing SalePoint resources for fresh deployment

### Step 3: Deploy Backend Infrastructure
```bash
./deploy-learner-lab-simple.sh
```

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**What this does:**
- Creates CloudFormation stack
- Sets up DynamoDB tables (products, customers, orders)
- Deploys Lambda functions
- Configures API Gateway
- Sets up IAM roles and CORS

### Step 4: Fix Lambda Function Issues (Critical!)
```bash
./fix-lambda-502-final.sh
```

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**What this does:** Fixes common Lambda handler configuration issues that cause 502 errors

### Step 5: Verify Complete Deployment
```bash
./deploy-complete-final.sh
```

**Duration:** 1 minute  
**What this does:** Tests all APIs and provides deployment status

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Deployment is Complete When:
✅ **All APIs return HTTP 200:**
- Products API: `https://[api-id].execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/products`
- Customers API: `https://[api-id].execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/customers`
- Orders API: `https://[api-id].execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/orders`

✅ **CloudFormation Stack Status:** `CREATE_COMPLETE`  
✅ **All Lambda Functions:** Active and responding  
✅ **DynamoDB Tables:** Created and accessible  

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### Issue 1: AWS CLI Not Configured
**Error:** `Unable to locate credentials`

**Solution:**
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Academy Lab credentials
# Make sure to use us-east-1 as region
```

### Issue 2: Permission Denied on Scripts
**Error:** `Permission denied: ./deploy-foolproof.sh`

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
# Makes all scripts executable
```

### Issue 3: CloudFormation Stack Already Exists
**Error:** `Stack already exists`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean up and start fresh
./cleanup.sh salepoint-lab us-east-1 true
# Wait 3-5 minutes, then redeploy
./deploy-foolproof.sh
```

### Issue 4: Lambda Functions Return 502 Errors
**Error:** API endpoints return HTTP 502

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run the Lambda fix script
./fix-lambda-502-final.sh
# This fixes handler configuration issues
```

### Issue 5: Template Validation Failed ✅ FIXED!
**Error:** `Template validation failed` or `Unable to load paramfile file://`

**Root Cause:** Script attempts template validation when deployment is already operational

**Solution (🆕 AUTOMATICALLY FIXED):**
```bash
# The deploy-foolproof.sh script now automatically:
# 1. Detects if deployment is already working
# 2. Skips template validation if APIs are operational
# 3. Shows API URL and exits gracefully

# Simply run the fixed script:
./deploy-foolproof.sh
```

**Manual Alternative:**
```bash
# Check if already deployed first
./quick-status.sh

# If APIs are working, no deployment needed!
# If not working, then deploy:
./deploy-foolproof.sh
```

### Issue 6: Stack Creation Timeout
**Error:** Stack creation takes too long

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check stack events for specific failures
aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name salepoint-lab
# Usually caused by resource limits in Academy Lab
# Wait and try again, or use fewer resources
```

### Issue 7: API Gateway Not Accessible
**Error:** Cannot access API endpoints

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify stack outputs
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name salepoint-lab --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
# Check CORS configuration and API deployment
```

### Issue 8: AWS Academy Template Validation Error ✅ FIXED!
**Error:** `AccessDenied when calling the ValidateTemplate operation: User: arn:aws:sts::ACCOUNT:assumed-role/voclabs/user is not authorized to perform: cloudformation:ValidateTemplate`

**Root Cause:** AWS Academy Learner Lab environments restrict the `cloudformation:ValidateTemplate` operation for security reasons

**Solution (🆕 AUTOMATICALLY FIXED):**
```bash
# The deploy-foolproof.sh script now automatically:
# 1. Detects AWS Academy Learner Lab environment
# 2. Skips template validation when restricted
# 3. Continues with deployment (validation happens during CloudFormation deploy)

# Simply run the fixed script:
./deploy-foolproof.sh
```

**What Changed:**
- Scripts automatically detect AWS Academy by checking the IAM role ARN
- Template validation is skipped if `voclabs` or `LabRole` is detected
- Template validation still occurs during actual CloudFormation deployment
- No manual intervention required

**Manual Alternative (if needed):**
```bash
# If you see this error in other scripts, run the fix:
./fix-aws-academy-validation.sh

# Then continue with deployment:
./deploy-foolproof.sh
```

**AWS Academy Specific Notes:**
- This is normal behavior in AWS Academy environments
- Template validation is a pre-deployment check that's restricted for security
- CloudFormation will still validate the template during actual deployment
- Your deployment will work exactly the same way
