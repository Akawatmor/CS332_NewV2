## 🔧 **OPTION A: Quick Deployment (Recommended)**
*Use this if you want to deploy everything quickly*

### Step 1: Deploy Complete Solution
```bash
cd "/Users/kong/Desktop/CS232-332_Cloud/final_project/CS332_NewV2_1/SalePoint Solution"
./deploy-complete.sh
```
**What it does**: Deploys backend + frontend + configures everything automatically

## 🔧 **OPTION B: Step-by-Step Deployment**
*Use this if you want to understand each component*

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Infrastructure
```bash
cd "/Users/kong/Desktop/CS232-332_Cloud/final_project/CS332_NewV2_1/SalePoint Solution"
./deploy-learner-lab-simple.sh
```
**What it does**: 
- Creates CloudFormation stack
- Deploys API Gateway
- Creates Lambda functions
- Sets up DynamoDB tables

### Step 2: Test and Configure
```bash
./test-learner-lab.sh
```
**What it does**:
- Tests all API endpoints
- Updates aws-config.js with real API URLs
- Validates deployment

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend (Regular Version)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
aws s3 sync build/ s3://salepoint-frontend-747605646409-us-east-1 --delete
```

### Step 4: Deploy Demo Frontend (No Authentication)
```bash
./deploy-demo.sh
```
**What it does**:
- Builds authentication-free version
- Uploads to S3
- Provides immediate dashboard access

---

## 🔧 **OPTION C: Incremental Deployment**
*Use this if you want maximum control*

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Only
```bash
./deploy-learner-lab-simple.sh
```

### Step 2: Validate Backend
```bash
./test-api.sh
```

### Step 3: Update Configuration
```bash
./test-learner-lab.sh
```

### Step 4: Build Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### Step 5: Deploy Demo Version
```bash
./deploy-demo.sh
```

---

## 📋 **Complete Fresh Deployment Process**

If you want to start completely fresh:

### Step 1: Clean Up (Optional)
```bash
./cleanup-learner-lab.sh  # Only if you want to start fresh
```

### Step 2: Deploy Everything
```bash
./deploy-complete.sh      # Complete deployment
```

### Step 3: Test Deployment
```bash
./test-learner-lab.sh     # Verify everything works
```
