# SalePoint Solution - End-to-End System Testing Guide

## Current Status
The SalePoint Solution is **feature-complete** with:
- ✅ Complete CloudFormation infrastructure template
- ✅ All Lambda functions with fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Full API Gateway configuration with CORS
- ✅ React frontend application
- ✅ Database schemas and initialization scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive testing scripts

## Prerequisites for Deployment

### AWS Credentials Setup
Before running any tests, you need to configure AWS credentials:

#### For AWS Academy Learner Lab:
1. Start your AWS Academy Lab session
2. Click "AWS Details" to get your credentials
3. Run the credential setup script:
   ```powershell
   .\setup_student_aws.sh  # (Linux/Mac)
   # Or manually configure AWS CLI with the provided credentials
   ```

#### Manual AWS CLI Configuration:
```powershell
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
# Enter your default region (us-east-1)
# Enter output format (json)
```

## End-to-End Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment
```powershell
# Deploy the complete infrastructure
.\deploy.ps1 -ProjectName "salepoint" -Region "us-east-1" -Environment "dev"
```

Expected duration: 15-20 minutes

### Phase 2: System Health Check
```powershell
# Run comprehensive system status check
.\check-status-simple.ps1 -StackName "salepoint-infrastructure" -Region "us-east-1"
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Infrastructure: CloudFormation stack deployed successfully
- ✅ Database: RDS instance available
- ✅ Lambda: All functions active
- ✅ API Gateway: Endpoints responding
- ✅ Frontend: S3 bucket with content
- ✅ Security: Cognito User Pool active

### Phase 3: API Validation
```powershell
# Test all API endpoints
.\validate-api.ps1 -StackName "salepoint-infrastructure" -Region "us-east-1"
```

This will test:
- Products API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Customers API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Sales API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Inventory API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Analytics API (GET)
- Documents API (GET, POST, DELETE)

### Phase 4: Frontend Application Testing
```powershell
# Get the frontend URL from CloudFormation outputs
$frontendUrl = aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name salepoint-infrastructure --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='FrontendBucketUrl'].OutputValue" --output text

# Open in browser for manual testing
Start-Process $frontendUrl
```

Manual tests:
1. User authentication (login/logout)
2. Product management interface
3. Customer data management
4. Sales tracking functionality
5. Inventory monitoring
6. Analytics dashboard
7. Document management

## Testing Without AWS Credentials

If you don't have AWS credentials set up, you can still test the application logic:

### 1. Test Lambda Functions Locally
```powershell
# Test Lambda functions with Node.js
cd "src\lambda"
node -e "
const salesTracking = require('./salesTracking.js');
// Simulate API Gateway event
const testEvent = {
    httpMethod: 'GET',
    path: '/sales',
    queryStringParameters: {}
};
salesTracking.handler(testEvent).then(console.log);
"
```

### 2. Frontend Development Server
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
# This will start the React app on http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. API Simulation
The Lambda functions are designed with fallback mechanisms:
- When AWS services are unavailable, they return mock data
- This allows testing the complete application flow
- All functions include error handling for student account limitations

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing (Optional)
```powershell
# Use the API testing script with loops for load testing
# Test API Gateway throttling and Lambda concurrency
```

### Database Performance
```powershell
# Test RDS connection performance
node diagnose_mysql_connection.js
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### CloudWatch Logs
After deployment, monitor:
- `/aws/lambda/salepoint-products`
- `/aws/lambda/salepoint-customers`
- `/aws/lambda/salepoint-sales`
- `/aws/lambda/salepoint-inventory`
- `/aws/lambda/salepoint-analytics`
- `/aws/lambda/salepoint-documents`

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. AWS Credentials Expired
**Symptom**: "Unable to locate credentials" error
**Solution**: Re-run credential setup or restart AWS Academy Lab

#### 2. CloudFormation Stack Creation Failed
**Symptom**: Stack in CREATE_FAILED state
**Solution**: 
```powershell
# Check stack events
aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name salepoint-infrastructure

# Delete failed stack and retry
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name salepoint-infrastructure
```

#### 3. Lambda Functions Not Responding
**Symptom**: API returns 5xx errors
**Solution**: Check CloudWatch logs and verify IAM permissions

#### 4. Database Connection Issues
**Symptom**: Database connectivity failures
**Solution**: Verify security groups and RDS endpoint configuration
